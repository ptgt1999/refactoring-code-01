# refactoring-code-01

## Description

This code was refactored to make two things happen. First and foremost, we wanted the code to be condensed. This removed things that happened to be repetative and allowed for the code to be cleaner and easier to read. The second thing we wanted to happen was to make the website more accessible to those who require website readers. 

## Installation

First, I went in to the HTML file and condenced and cleaned up the starter code. Second, I went in to each of the lines of codes that added an image and provided an alt text for each image in the html. Third, I went in to the CSS file and condenced and cleaned the code, and in doing so, I created new classes by replacing the old ones, so I went back in to the HTML file so that the two files lined up properly. 

## Usage

On the website, a user can Right Click -> Inspect -> and in elements they can expand the contents and/or the benefits tabs inorder to see the alt texts. 

## Credits

I know we're not supposed to, but I couldn't figure out how to add alt text, so I asked Chat GPT. But otherwise, I didn't use anything else.
